# gbparseR
Utils script containing R code for parsing genbank flat files
WARNING:  THIS HAS ONLY BEEN TESTED WITH PROKARYOTIC GENOMES.  
Thats because it probably would need much more work to make this flexible enough to deal with all the eukaryotic complications


We reccomend that you use this file by itself after obtaining a sample genbank file (such as the listed S. aureus genome, found here: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/NC_007795)

When confident of usage, comment (#) the lines containing the #^^^^^^^^^ markers and source the file as needed


Feedback is welcome!
